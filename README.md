## Installation

Plugin is currently distributed in Chrome web store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ontology-web-wallet/dkdedlpgdmmkkfjabffeganieamfklkm . To build manually see the steps below. Or you can download pre-build plugin for Chrome from Release page.

### Required Tools and Dependencies

* Node
* Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Developing and Running

Execute these commands in the project's root directory:

Setup:

#### Install yarn
For faster building process and development experience install Yarn

```
npm install --global yarn
```

#### Download
```
git clone 'https://github.com/backslash47/ontology-plugin-wallet.git'
```

#### Start development server
This will run the wallet as an web application accessible on http://localhost:3000 using web local storage for wallet storage.

````
yarn start
````

#### Build extension
This will build the extension for installation into browsers. 

````
yarn start
````

#### Ledger support
Ledger support is provided by the Ontology TS SDK extension https://github.com/OntologyCommunityDevelopers/ontology-ts-sdk-ledger. Because Chrome allows communication with the Ledger only from HTTPS loaded page (which extension is not), there is used a HTTPS iframe embedded. The iframe is hosted on https://drxwrxomfjdx5.cloudfront.net/forwarder.html and the source codes are at https://github.com/OntologyCommunityDevelopers/ledger-forwarder . To change the Iframe address navigate to index.tsx and change the call to 

````
Ledger.setLedgerTransport(new Ledger.LedgerTransportIframe('https://drxwrxomfjdx5.cloudfront.net/forwarder.html', true));
````

To use your Ledger, you also needs Ontology Ledger App located at https://github.com/xavizhao/blue-app-ont . It is not yet installable from Ledger Manager, so manual installation is necessary.
